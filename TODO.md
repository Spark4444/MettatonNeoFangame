# TODOs and Bugs

## Bugs
1. The game doesn't play the main menu music after the player dies, it will play after the play if the player uses the input to change volume.
2. IMPORTANT: The attack menu may sometimes just deal 0 damage to the enemy, and gets stuck at the start of the line. I don't know the specific conditions of the bug, it doesn't have a specific order when it happens like every 3rd attack or something like that. try testing the varaibles related to the attack menu to see what's wrong with it.
